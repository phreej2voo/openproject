  module ColumnType
    # Column to specify start date and due date using an ascii calendar.
    #
    # The title of the column is "MTWTFSS" to represent the days of the week.
    #
    # The Monday is the next occuring Monday meaning the dates can be different
    # from one test run to another. To always use the same dates please use
    # `travel_to` with a fixed date.
    #
    # Use 'X' to mark the days from start to due date. Only the first and last
    # 'X' are considered as start and due dates.
    # Use '[' to mark the start date only and ']' for the due date only.
    # Any other character is ignored
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   | subject                   | MTWTFSS   |
    #   | main                      | XXX       |
    #   | crossing non working days |  XXXX..XX |
    #   | start date only           | [         |
    #   | due date only             |     ]     |
    #   | no dates                  |           |
    #
