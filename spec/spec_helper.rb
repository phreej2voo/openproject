# This file was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
# The generated `.rspec` file contains `--require spec_helper` which will cause
# this file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any
# files.
#
# Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as
# light-weight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file
# will add to the boot time of your test suite on EVERY test run, even for an
# individual file that may not need all of that loaded. Instead, consider making
# a separate helper file that requires the additional dependencies and performs
# the additional setup, and require it from the spec files that actually need
# it.
#
# The `.rspec` file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that
# users commonly want.
#
# See http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration

# We currently require rails_helper here, since we loaded
# the environment at all times before and have almost no specs that may run outside
require_relative "rails_helper"
# Specs not relying on Rails can require rspec_helper directly for faster loading
require_relative "rspec_helper"

RSpec.configure do |config|
  # Have the FactoryBot methods like #create and #build_stubbed without
  # having to call it on FactoryBot.
