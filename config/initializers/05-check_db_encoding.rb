      INCOMPATIBLE DATABASE ENCODING DETECTED

      Your database encoding is #{database_encoding}, which is incompatible with ICU
      collation used in OpenProject v15.

      Please check the instructions on how to change database encoding:
      https://www.openproject.org/docs/installation-and-operations/misc/changing-database-encoding/

      This check can be skipped by setting environment variable OPENPROJECT_SKIP_DB_ENCODING_CHECK=true
