## Deprecation warning

We no longer recommend to use these icons as we decided to switch to the [Octicons](https://github.com/opf/openproject-octicons) provided by the [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/foundations/icons/).

## Structure

This directory is the source for the generated icon font in the Rails
`frontend/src/global_styles/fonts` directory.


## Rebuilding

We will no longer add icons to that font.
