// This is rather ugly. Due to `appendTo=body`, we loose the context information for the dropdown.
// So in order to know, when the dropdown is part of a user-autocompleter, we look whether there is a specific class inside.
// The user-autocompleter gets an enforced min-width because the names are often times cut off way too early.
