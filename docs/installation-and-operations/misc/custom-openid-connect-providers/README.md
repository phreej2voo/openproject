# Custom OpenID Connect providers (Enterprise add-on)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OpenID Connect providers is an Enterprise add-on. If you do not see the button you will have to activate the Enterprise edition first.

Starting with OpenProject 15.0., you can create custom OpenID Connect providers with the user interface [OpenID Providers Authentication Guide](../../../system-admin-guide/authentication/openid-providers/). 

Please use this document for references on all configuration options. Any providers you have created in earlier versions will have been migrated and should be available from the user interface.
