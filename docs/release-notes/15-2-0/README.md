# OpenProject 15.2.0

Release date: 2025-01-22

We released [OpenProject 15.2.0](https://community.openproject.org/versions/2143). The release contains several bug fixes, and we recommend updating to the newest version.
In these Release Notes, we will give an overview of important feature changes. At the end, you will find a complete list of all changes and bug fixes.

## Important feature changes

### Work package reminders

You can now use the Reminder function to receive a reminder about a work package at a later point in time. Simply navigate to any work package, select the **Reminder icon** and specify when you would like to be reminded. You will receive a notification in the notification center.

> [!TIP]
> You can also receive immediate notifications via e-mail for personal reminders. To do that, [adjust your account settings](../../user-guide/account-settings/#email-reminders) accordingly.

### Export timesheets as PDF

Time reports can now be exported not only in Excel, but also in PDF format. Navigate to the Time and costs module of your project, specify all report filters according to your needs, and press the **Export PDF timesheet** button.

Here is an example of a timesheet PDF export:

> [!TIP]
> Keep in mind that this time report will only include time entries, but not the cost ones.

### Add a lag to Predecessor/Successor relations

For Predecessor/Successor relations, you can now specify a **lag**, which represents the minimum number of working days to maintain between two work packages. This flexibility ensures more precise scheduling and helps align task dependencies effectively. By default, the lag is set to 0 working days, but you can update the *Description* and *Lag* fields anytime to adapt to changes in your project timeline.

### Create a new folder directly when using file storages integrations

Users can now create a folder structure directly while selecting the destination folder for file uploads, enhancing the integration with both **Nextcloud** and **OneDrive/SharePoint**. This improvement simplifies the process by allowing users to organize their files during the upload, without the need to separately create folders in the file storage, thus streamlining workflows and improving overall efficiency.

### Group and order by for custom fields of type hierarchy

Users can now sort their work package list by the assigned values of custom fields of type hierarchy. This enhancement allows for a more efficient overview, helping users quickly organize and filter work packages within a specific hierarchical context. Here is an example of how work packages grouped by a custom field of a type hierarchy looks like:

![Work packages grouped by a custom field of type hierarchy](openproject_cf_hierarchy_grouping.png)

### Popover on user information on hover

To simplify accessing specific user details without needing to navigate to their profile, user information will now be displayed when hovering over a user's avatar, on pages like the Members or Activity page.

![User information is displayed when hovering over avatar in OpenProject](openproject_avatar_hover.png)

### Continued updating page headers and subheaders

We continued introducing standardized components for page headers and subheaders across multiple project pages, to further improve design consistency.
