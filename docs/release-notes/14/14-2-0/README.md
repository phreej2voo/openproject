# OpenProject 14.2.0

Release date: 2024-06-19

We released [OpenProject 14.2.0](https://community.openproject.org/versions/2040). The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version. In these Release Notes, we will give an overview of  important feature changes. At the end, you will find a complete list of  all changes and bug fixes.

## Important feature changes

### Display Work and Remaining work in days and hours

With OpenProject 14.2, we enhanced the accuracy of progress reporting. Previously, time for Work, Remaining work, and spent time could only be specified in hours. Now, it is also possible to specify these units in days. Administrators of the instance can set the number of hours that constitute a day under administration/calendars-and-dates.

A work package table displaying Work and Remaining work might now look like this:

![Work package table showing Work and Remaining work in days and hours](openproject-14-2-progress-reporting-work-package-table-highlighted.png)

For more information, see [#50954](https://community.openproject.org/wp/50954).

### Exclude by status some work packages from the calculation of totals for % Complete and work estimates 

Project managers can now exclude rejected or duplicate work packages from the calculation of total Work, total Remaining work and total % Complete for the parent / ancestors work packages. This allows them to clean up estimates and progress when rejecting child work packages or marking them as duplicates.

Learn more in our [documentation about work package settings](../../../system-admin-guide/manage-work-packages/work-package-settings/).

### Warn admins about potential data loss when changing progress calculation modes

To avoid loosing data when switching from Work- to Status-based progress calculation, OpenProject will now show you a warning banner if you select a different mode than the current. If you switch from Work- to Status-based progress calculation, please note that:

* Existing % Complete values are overwritten by status (or set to 0 when a corresponding value does not exist).

* Remaining work is automatically updated.

### Configure which projects are activated for a project attribute

With OpenProject 14.2, administrators can now save time by enabling or disabling project attributes across multiple projects simultaneously. For instance, if you want to adjust the 'Due date' attribute for all projects, the setting looks like this: 

![Configure which projects are activated for a project attribute](openproject-14-2-project-attributes-settings-highlighted.png)

In the screenshot, the three-dot menu on the right is selected. With one click, you can deactivate the attribute for the entire project and its subprojects.

### Avoid redundant emails in case of @mentions and email reminder

With the release of OpenProject 14.2, we avoid sending redundant emails: Users who are @mentioned in a work package will still receive immediate emails based on their email reminder settings. But if an email has already been sent for an @mention (assuming the user has activated the option ‘Immediately when someone @mentions me’ in the email notifications), subsequent notifications with mentions as the primary reason will not be included in the email reminder.

### Allow renaming persisted project lists

Regarding project portfolio management, users can now not only create and save a private custom project list, but also rename it. This saves time since previously, you would have had to create a new project list to change the name.

### Allow meeting invite to be sent out when creating meetings

The Meeting module has been further improved with OpenProject 14.2: When users create a new meeting in OpenProject, they will now see a checkbox allowing them to choose whether to email the invited users. If checked, OpenProject will send invitation emails to all new participants.

In addition to this feature, the default view for meetings module was changed to display the upcoming invitations.

### Embedded work package attributes in PDF export

With OpenProject 14.2, [embedded attributes within a work package description](../../../user-guide/wysiwyg/#embedding-of-work-package-attributes-and-project-attributes) (and long text custom fields) are displayed in the PDF export as on OpenProject. This means you can reference values from work packages with placeholders, and on export these are replaced by their actual value of a project or work package attributes.
