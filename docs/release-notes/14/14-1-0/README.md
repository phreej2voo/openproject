# OpenProject 14.1.0

Release date: 2024-05-22

We released [OpenProject 14.1.0](https://community.openproject.org/versions/2030). The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version. In these Release Notes, we will give an overview of important feature changes. At the end, you will find a complete list of all changes and bug fixes.

## Important updates and breaking changes

### Fixes a stored XSS vulnerability in the cost report functionality (CVE-2024-135224)

OpenProject Cost Report functionality uses improper sanitization of user input. This can lead to Stored XSS via the header values of the report table. This attack requires the permissions "Edit work packages" as well as "Add attachments".

For more information, [please see our security advisory](https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-h26c-j8wg-frjc).

### Deprecation of Univention app center packages

We unfortunately can no longer provide the OpenProject app for the Univention app center due to incompatibility of their PostgreSQL version in app center 5.0. They have announced that a newer PostgreSQL version will be available in a newer version of the app center.
This means that we are unable to provide new versions of OpenProject in the Univention app center. The last version available in the app center is OpenProject 13.4.1.

As OpenProject currently does not provide its own multi-container setup, the app is no longer upgradable. We recommend you switch to a docker- or packaged-based installation instead. Please use the [integrated backup functionality](../../../system-admin-guide/backup/) to extract a backup from your installation. See the [restoration guide](../../../installation-and-operations/operation/restoring/) on how to restore this backup to a new installation.

In the future, we are collaborating with Univention to provide a connector app for OpenProject, allowing you to integrate their IDM solution
into an existing deployed OpenProject application.

### Removal of all-in-one PostgreSQL exposed port

In the all-in-one Dockerfile, up until now, both port 80 and 5432 (PostgreSQL database) were exposed by default.
As we are also not exposing other services such as memcached, we removed the PostgreSQL port for consistency.

If you need to work on the database directly, you can still use the `docker exec -it <container id> pg_dump` command to e.g., access pg_dump.

## Important feature changes

### PDF export of Gantt view, e.g. for printing (Enterprise add-on)

It is now possible to export a Gantt view as PDF in the OpenProject Enterprise edition. This allows users to easily print Gantt charts in a nice design. Choose between different paper formats, set the column width, and specify whether the PDF file should display your work packages on a daily, monthly or quarterly basis.

Please note that we plan to further improve the [PDF export of Gantt view](../../../user-guide/gantt-chart/#gantt-chart-pdf-export-enterprise-add-on) in future releases.

### Favorite projects

This feature was requested by many in the Community and will be a great benefit, especially for organizations with many projects: OpenProject 14.1 allows you to add projects to favorites so that they can be found more quickly. We [recently gave an overview in our blog](https://www.openproject.org/blog/favorite-projects/) of how exactly you can add projects to favorites or remove them from favorites – and where you can display them.

![OpenProject dropdown menu showing favorite projects, displayed with yellow stars](openproject-14-1-favorite-projects-overview.shadow.png)

See our documentation to learn more about [how to mark a project as favorite](../../../user-guide/project-overview/#mark-a-project-as-favorite).

### Advanced features for the Meetings module

The Meetings module is currently being continuously improved. With OpenProject 14.1.:

- you can group agenda items with sections,
- notes are open when creating new agenda items,
- and the status now changes to open when you copy a closed meeting.

![OpenProject's Meetings module, separated in sections](openproject-14-1-meetings-sections-highlighted.png)

Apart from these features that apply the Meetings module directly, the following changes concerning OpenProject meetings have been made:

- In work packages, the project name is now shown in the Meetings tab.
- Calendar widgets on the My Page and project overview pages can now show meetings.

![A calendar widget on a project overview page, now showing upcoming meetings](openproject-14-1-meetings-widget-project-overview.png)

**Please note**: On the project overview page and on the My page, the "+" button on the top right has been removed. However, new widgets can be added by project admins as usual if you hover at the border of an existing widget and click on the “+” there.

Read more about [dynamic meetings in OpenProject](../../../user-guide/meetings/dynamic-meetings/).

### Possibility to hide attachments in the Files tab

Admins now are able to hide the attachment section in the Files tab. This setting can be changed both at an instance and project levels and is particularly useful for projects where users should only upload files via external storage, e.g. Nextcloud.

To make this possible Attachment and Files Storages settings were moved together under **Files** section, both in the [instance administration](../../../system-admin-guide/files/attachments/) and under [project settings](../../../user-guide/projects/project-settings/files/).

![Show attachments setting in OpenProject](openproject-14-1-administration-files.png)

### File storages module activated by default

In connection with the feature above, activating file storages integrations was simplified. It is no longer required to active **Files storages** module under project settings. Instead, available file storages are visible under *Project settings > Files > External file storages*, as long as the user has *Manage file storages in project* permission.

![External file storages under project settings in OpenProject](openproject-14-1-project-settings-files.png)

### Custom fields of the type Link (URL)

Users can now create custom field of the type Link (URL). Remember to activate it for your project(s) and specific work package type for it to be displayed. The custom field type Link shows an error message if you type in an invalid URL.

![Create a custom field of the type Link](openproject-14-1-custom-field-link.png)

Read more about [custom fields](../../../system-admin-guide/custom-fields/).

### Save a changed sort order of custom project lists

Custom project lists can now not only be changed in order, but also saved as such. Additionally, you can change your own saved lists and save them again so that you do not have to start from scratch.

Read more on [project lists](../../../user-guide/projects/project-lists/).

### A "Manage project attributes" button on the project overview page

With OpenProject 14.0, we released the feature to create a custom set of project attributes grouped in sections on the project overview page. With 14.1, you will additionally have a button to [Manage project attributes](../../../user-guide/project-overview/#project-attributes) on the project overview page.

### OneDrive/SharePoint: A "no permission“ message to file links

If you use the OneDrive/SharePoint integration, you will now be shown a "no permission" message if you try to access a file for which you lack permission.
