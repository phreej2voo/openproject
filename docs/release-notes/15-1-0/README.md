# OpenProject 15.1.0

Release date: 2024-12-11

We released [OpenProject 15.1.0](https://community.openproject.org/versions/2122). The release contains several bug fixes, and we recommend updating to the newest version.
In these Release Notes, we will give an overview of important feature changes and technical updates. At the end, you will find a complete list of all changes and bug fixes.

## Important feature changes

### Custom fields of type hierarchy (Enterprise add-on)

Enterprise customers can now use a new type of custom field that allows **multi-level selections in a hierarchial way**. This makes it easier for users to organize and navigate complex data in structured, multi-level formats within work packages. The new custom fields of the hierarchy type can be added to work packages and then structured into several lower-level items.

Each custom field of type hierarchy can be given a short name (e.g. B for Berlin). Here's an example of how custom fields of the hierarchy type look like, using the example of a detailed assignment of workspaces:

![Example screenshot of custom fields of type hierarchy, displaying different cities as main offices](openproject-15-1-custom-field-hierarchy.jpg)

[Read all about this new type of custom field in our system admin guide](../../system-admin-guide/custom-fields/#hierarchy-custom-field-enterprise-add-on).

### Redesign of the Relations tab in work packages

The Relations tab in work packages has been completely redesigned using Primer design system, including a **new dropdown menu that allows you to directly choose the type of relation**, e.g. if the related work package is a successor (earlier called 'Follows') and necessarily needs to start after the selected one finishes. Scroll down to see more types of relations.

Additionally, you can now add a description to add further information about the relation. Please note that the description will be displayed on both work packages, below the related other work package.

> [!NOTE]
> Important information: With this redesign, **you will no longer be able to create new work packages directly on the Relations tab**. We are already working on a solution and plan to release this feature early next year. Thank you for your understanding.

> [!TIP]
> As a workaround you can [include a table of related work packages to work package forms (Enterprise add-on)](../../system-admin-guide/manage-work-packages/work-package-types/#add-table-of-related-work-packages-to-a-work-package-form-enterprise-add-on). Under this table you can directly create new children work packages or link existing ones.

### Redesign of the Meetings index page

The index page of the Meetings module has been redesigned with Primer as well, making it easier to read and adding a more modern look. You see your list of meetings in column view, with the columns being: Title, Date and time, Duration, and Location.

The + Meeting button in the top right corner now offers a dropdown menu where you can directly choose whether you want to add a dynamic or a classic meeting.

Here's an example screenshot of the redesigned Meetings index page:

### Manual page breaks in PDF work package exports

With our work package export feature, people can generate good-looking PDFs. Sometimes, however, the page break comes at an inconvenient place. With version 15.1, users can now force a manual page break in the work package description. This ensures, for example, that a signature can always be inserted on the correct page. Please note that logically, manual page breaks only work if the work package description is part of the PDF export – and not in the PDF export of a work package table if you choose the export type 'Table'.

### Zen mode for project lists

Zen mode allows users to focus on a certain page, as all other menu items and elements are hidden, and the page is displayed in full screen. OpenProject already offers zen mode for other modules like Work packages, Boards, Gantt charts or Calendars – and with version 15.1 also for project lists.

Here is how zen mode for project lists looks like:

## Important technical updates

### Possibility to lock seeded admin users, e.g. when using LDAP

Administrators of automated deployments can now choose to skip the automatically integrated creation of an admin user. This is useful if you have set up an LDAP or SSO integration – such as those used for openDesk environments – and you want to prevent the admin user from logging in. Administrators no longer have to manually disable this automatically created admin user and thus run the risk of forgetting to do so, which would pose a security risk.
