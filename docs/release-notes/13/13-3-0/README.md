# OpenProject 13.3.0

Release date: 2024-02-14

We released [OpenProject 13.3.0](https://community.openproject.org/versions/1487).
The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version.

## New features

In addition to other changes, OpenProject version 13.3 includes the following three important features:

### Separate Gantt charts module

One major change is the relocation of the Gantt views to a separate module. Please note that with OpenProject 13.3 all saved work package queries (private or public) with an activated Gantt view moved to the new Gantt charts module.

You can navigate to the new Gantt chart module either via the side menu in a project or via the global menu:

The view button from the work package module is now only present in the BIM version of OpenProject and only for switching from the list to the cards view.

### Filter and save custom project lists

OpenProject has enhanced the project filter list view and now lets you create custom project lists by saving your preferred filter settings. Please note that in future releases, the project lists will be further improved and additional features will be added.

### OneDrive/SharePoint integration: Automatically managed project folders (Enterprise add-on)

With this release, admins of an Enterprise edition can choose between manually or automatically managed project folders. If you select the latter, all project members are automatically granted access to the project folder.
