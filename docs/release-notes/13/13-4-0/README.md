- [More languages added to the default available set](#more-languages-added-to-the-default-available-set)

### GitLab integration

We are delighted about the GitLab integration, which is officially available with OpenProject 13.4. It goes back to the plugin that Community contributor [Benjamin Tey](https://community.openproject.org/users/69094) created 3 years ago. Many thanks at this point to everyone who worked on the GitLab integration and the plugin â€“ inside and outside of OpenProject's core development team! Such projects are a great example of the power of open source collaboration.ðŸ’™

With this integration, you can manage GitLab's units of work (merge requests and issues) from within OpenProject by linking them with work packages. Read more about OpenProject's GitLab integration [in our system admin guide](../../../system-admin-guide/integrations/gitlab-integration/).

<div class="blog-box-info">

**Already using the user-generated GitLab plugin?** With OpenProject 13.4, the existing plugin will be replaced by the new integration. We recommend removing the plugin module folder and bundler references before upgrading to OpenProject. Your historical dataset will remain unaffected within OpenProject as there were no changes to the data model.

Before upgrading, please do the following:

1. Remove traces of the GitLab integration in your **Gemfile.lock** and **Gemfile.modules**. See [btey/openproject-gitlab-integration#configuration](https://github.com/btey/openproject-gitlab-integration?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration). Failure to do so may result in a `Bundler::GemfileError` matching the following error message: _Your Gemfile lists the gem openproject-gitlab_integration (>= 0) more than once._
2. Remove the module code traces of the GitLab integration by running this command: `rm -rf /path/to/openproject/modules/gitlab_integration`

### Advanced features for custom project lists

With OpenProject 13.4 we are again releasing further features for custom [project lists](../../../user-guide/projects/project-lists/). The most important update here is that you can now modify the selection and order of columns, then save them in a  newly configured view, much like how you typically manage a work package list.

In addition, you will now be reminded to save changes to your project list in the form of a **Save link** in the top right corner. This helps users remember to save the view and not lose their work when they leave the page.

### Advanced features for the Meetings module

We also worked intensively on the Meetings module for 13.4: From now on, you can also **attach files (e.g. images) to OpenProject's dynamic meetings**. This will look like this, for example:

![Add images and other files to your Meetings](meetings-openproject-13-4-files.png)

Another long-awaited improvement: When you copy a dynamic meeting, **existing agenda items are now also copied**. This saves a lot of time and work for recurring meetings.

![Copy a meeting with agenda](openproject-13-4-meetings-copy-agenda-highlighted.png)

And finally, the .ics file now also contains information about the (dynamic) meeting attendees - in addition to other existing information such as PARTSTAT. This now allows you to **confirm or decline invitations to a meeting directly in your calendar software**.

<div class="blog-box-info">

Stay tuned: Further advanced features for our Meetings module are planned for upcoming releases â€“ take a look at [this EPIC](https://community.openproject.org/projects/openproject/work_packages/52820/activity?query_id=4929) for detailed information.

### Virus scanning functionality with ClamAV (Enterprise add-on)

Another important step towards data security: With OpenProject 13.4, users' uploaded files can be scanned for viruses, using the ClamAV antivirus engine. To do so, a new attachment menu item is created with Antivirus settings. Read more about virus scanning using ClamAV in our [system admin guide](../../../system-admin-guide/files/attachments/virus-scanning/).

![OpenProject's admin settings for virus scanning with ClamAV](openproject_virus_scanning.png)

### Intermediate loading modal during the OAuth nudge

Admins are now shown an intermediate loading modal during the OAuth nudge follow when the redirect to the storage provider takes time.

![Intermediate loading modal during the OAuth nudge](openproject-13-4-intermediate-modal-nudging.jpg)

Accessibility functionality: Convey to screenreaders when OAuth login has started, while it's in progress, and when it's completed or failed.

### PDF Export: Lists in table cells are supported

OpenProject version 13.4 now supports PDF exports with lists in table cells that are displayed correctly. Export a work package that contains a table with lists in it into a PDF. Here is an example of how this looks from now on:

![Work package with a table in the description field and how it looks when exported as PDF](openproject-13-4-pdf-export-table-lists.png)

### WebAuthn/FIDO/U2F is added as a second factor

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a key factor in data security. With OpenProject 13.4, OpenProject offers a new method as a second factor. You can now use hardware tokens such as Yubikeys, browser or password manager passkeys that use the WebAuthn/FIDO/U2F standards.

### More languages added to the default available set

Thanks to our great Community we can continuously offer more languages for OpenProject. With OpenProject 13.4, users now have over 50 languages at their disposal. Previously there were less than ten, which is a considerable step forward. Please note, however, that only a few languages are officially reviewed and updated by OpenProject. This currently applies to English, German, French and Spanish. Regarding all other languages, we ask for your patience and [thank all Community contributors](#translation-contributors) from the bottom of our hearts.
