# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for meetings

## What is difference between a dynamic and classic meeting?

[Dynamic meetings](../dynamic-meetings) are an improved version of the meetings meant to improve the user experience when managing meetings in OpenProject.

## How long will the classic meetings be available?

[Classic meetings](../classic-meetings) will be deprecated with one of the future releases after 13.1. We will communicate this in advance to ensure a smooth transition for all our users.

## Can I add a meeting to a calendar?

Yes, you can [download a meeting as an iCalendar event](../dynamic-meetings/#download-a-meeting-as-an-icalendar-event).

## Are the meetings shown in calendar widgets?

Yes, the Calendar widget on the [project overview page](../../project-overview/#calendar-widget) and [My Page](../../../getting-started/my-page/#add-widgets) displays meetings. Meetings links in this widget are clickable and open the meeting directly.
