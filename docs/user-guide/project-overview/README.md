## What is the project overview?

The project overview is a single dashboard page where all important information of a selected project can be displayed. The idea is to provide a central repository of information for the whole project team. 

Project information is added to the dashboard as either [project attributes](#project-attributes) or [widgets](#widgets). 

Open the project overview by navigating to **Overview** in the project menu on the left.

## Project attributes

**Project attributes** are a set of project-level custom fields that let you display certain types of information relevant to your project.

You will see a list of all available project attributes in a pane on the right side of of your Project overview page. They may be grouped in sections.

> [!TIP]
> Your view of the project attributes may vary depending on on your  [roles and permissions in OpenProject](../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/roles-permissions/). 
> The project attributes are visible for users with the **View project attributes** permission enabled. The editing icons are visible for users with the **Edit project attributes** permission.

![Project overview page showing project attributes on the right side](openproject_user_guide_project_overview_project_attributes_section_new.png)

To edit the value of any visible project attribute, click on the **Edit** (pencil) icon next to the name of the section containing that project attribute. A modal will be displayed with all the attributes in that section.

![Edit a project attribute section on project overview page](openproject_user_guide_project_overview_project_attributes_section_edit_new.png)

Edit the values for each project attribute and click on **Save** to confirm and save your changes.
