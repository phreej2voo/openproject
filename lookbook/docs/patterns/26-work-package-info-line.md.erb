The work package info line is a consistent way to display the most commonly-used  set of basic work package attributes.

## Overview

<%= embed OpenProject::WorkPackages::InfoLineComponentPreview, :playground %>

## Anatomy

The info line consists of three attributes that are displayed together:

- Type
- ID
- Status

Only the ID the only interactive element; it is clickable and points the work package. All other interaction has to come from the element using this work component.

## Best practices

It's best to not separate these three elements in different lines. The element can, however, be wrapped in multi-line if needed.

## Used in

- Hovercard
- Work package relations tab
- Work package header
- ...

### Code structure

You can typically call the InfoLineComponent in views where work package details (Type, ID, and Status) need to be displayed in one line. You must pass a work package object containing valid data to it.

```html
    render(WorkPackages::InfoLineComponent.new(work_package: @work_package))
```
